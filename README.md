# 🧪 LLM Adversarial Testing Framework

Evaluate the robustness of large language models like GPT-4 and Gemini against adversarial prompts.

## 🚀 Project Goal
This project systematically tests LLMs using a suite of adversarial inputs to evaluate their alignment, safety, and consistency under edge-case conditions. It is designed to simulate real-world misuse scenarios and analyze failure modes.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Modular testing with categories such as:
  - Prompt Injection
  - Logic Traps
  - Reverse Psychology
  - Ethical Boundary Challenges
  - Response Drift (multi-turn)
- Supports testing across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- Logs, scores, and visualizes results
- Designed with extensibility and research in mind

## 🧠 Why This Matters
As LLMs are deployed in critical and public-facing systems, robustness to adversarial inputs is essential. This framework aims to:
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Provide reproducible testing
- Aid in building safer, more aligned models
